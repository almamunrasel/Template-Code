###array

first define an array of size n
let's take two pointer variable as front and rear
initilly both the value stays at zero
when the push function will be called the value x will be inserted in ara[rear] then will b rear ++


#stack

stack<int>s1,s2;

while(s1!=empty) 
s2.push(s1.top())


s1.push(x)


while(s2!empty()
 s1.push(s2.top())
